  ## The filezones where the jobs are being run, in relation to the Seamless database
  ## "the jobs are being run" means "where jobless is being run" for backend=shell
  ## For backend=slurm, it means "the file systems mounted on your SLURM cluster",
  ##  which may or may not be accessible to the Seamless database.
  ##
  ## The Seamless database with default configuration has a single store with filezone "local".
  ## If jobless runs on the same filesystem as the Seamless DB store, you should specify
  ##  the same filezone. This allows files for bash/bashdocker to be softlinked 
  ##  directly, rather than its buffer loaded into Seamless DB, sent over HTTP,
  ##  and written to a new file
