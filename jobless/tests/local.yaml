## The Seamless database adapter ("SeamlessDB") can store items in flat files.
## Flatfile rewriters are necessary when the flatfile directory inside the SeamlessDB container
##   is mounted under a different name than outside the container (where Cloudless runs)
## This happens when you run SeamlessDB under Docker.
## When SeamlessDB is run under Singularity, this should not be necessary

# flatfile_rewriters:
#   -
#     mounted: /data/              ## how it is mounted inside the container
#     external: /tmp/database/     ## the directory outside the container
