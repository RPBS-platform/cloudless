# - Current directory is mounted to /cwd, and the command is executed there
# - Seamless has access to the Docker daemon, so it can launch its own Docker
#    containers via the Docker transformer. This works only under Linux.
#    NOTE: THIS IS A BIG SECURITY HOLE, IT CAN GIVE ROOT ACCESS TO YOUR SYSTEM
#  - For now, direct Redis access is assumed, via the Redis port 6379
#    NOTE: THIS IS A BIG SECURITY HOLE, IT ALLOWS CORRUPTION AND SNOOPING OF THE DATABASE
#  - The share server listens on 0.0.0.0, because I can't find out 
#      how Docker Bridge rewrites the IP address origin
#    NOTE: THIS IS A BIG SECURITY HOLE IF YOUR EPHEMERAL PORTS ARE VISIBLE TO THE OUTSIDE
